## rticles Gallery

### Why?

I can never remember what the different templates from the
[rticles](https://github.com/rstudio/rticles) package (for RMarkdown-driven pdf-based papers) look
like.  So I made [a gallery](https://eddelbuettel.github.io/rticles-gallery/) to preview them. 

It contains (animated) gif files showing all pages of each template---and providing a link to the
underlying pdf from which the gif was derived.

There is also [one single gif](docs/all.gif) but it is bound to make your head spin.

### How?

It is really just a few lines in R, plus a callout to the command-line imagemagick /
graphicsmagick tool `convert`. See the file [script.R](script.R).
